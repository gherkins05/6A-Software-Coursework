Overview
--------

Our project is a web-application which allows users to record games from real life chess boards on their phone. It is intended to be used alongside a chess board to get the maximum experience and allows for game storage and to reload real life games online to self review or continue playing at a later date

Motivations
-----------

We created this project as we felt that over the board chess is a big part of the chess world still, yet can be lost from the downsides that online chess bring. Our intention was to fix this by allowing users playing over the board games to store their games on a device alongside the game to keep the match that the were playing while still benefitting from the over the board experience

Key Features
------------

Our solution consists of an OTB (Over The Board) Editor, Log-in and accounts system. Including game storage, and the ability to navigate backwards and forwards through different chess games to explore possible outcomes and changes within the game.
